In many cases these can be determined directly from a <<gazetteer>> or from an online tool such as Google Maps. If the coordinates of a feature need to be determined from other reference points that have coordinates on a map (such as the corners), there is a nice little trick that can be done with the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georeferencing Calculator] to determine the coordinates of the feature easily. For example, to georeference the locality \"10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield\", first determine the coordinates for \"Bakersfield\". Suppose the xref:ui-coordinate-source[role=ui-element] is the USGS Gosford 1:24,000 Quad map. Once the corrected centre of Bakersfield has been determined on the map, find a convenient spot on the map having known coordinates, such as the corner nearest to the feature.

msgid "The http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georeferencing Calculator^] is an excellent tool for investigating the contributions to <<uncertainty>> from distinct sources. For any given xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element], one can nullify all but one source of uncertainty to see what the contribution to overall uncertainty is from that source. For example, to see what the contribution to overall uncertainty is from an unknown <<datum>> at a given <<location>>, choose the \"Coordinate only\" xref:ui-locality-type[role=ui-element], set the xref:ui-input-latitude[role=ui-element] and xref:ui-input-longitude[role=ui-element] to the place that needs to be checked, set the xref:ui-coordinate-source[role=ui-element] to \"gazetteer\" or \"locality description\" (because neither of these choices contributes an uncertainty to the calculation), select \"datum not recorded\" from the xref:ui-datum[role=ui-element] drop-down list, select \"exact\" from the xref:ui-input-coordinate-precision[role=ui-element] drop-down list, set the xref:ui-measurement-error[role=ui-element] to \"0\". With these settings, the only source of uncertainty is the unknown datum. At the coordinate 0,0, the calculated uncertainty is 5030m, as shown in xref:img-isolating-uncertainty[xrefstyle=\"short\"]. This large uncertainty reflects the maximum distance between the point 0,0 in any <<geographic-coordinate-reference-system>> and the point 0,0 in the coordinate reference system <<WGS84>>.
