The application makes calculations using the theory given in {gbp}[Georeferencing Best Practices (Chapman & Wieczorek 2020)^], derived from the earlier http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/docs/GeorefGuide.html[MaNIS/HerpNET/ORNIS Georeferencing Guidelines (Wieczorek 2001)^], and https://doi.org/10.1080/13658810412331280211[The point-radius method for georeferencing locality descriptions and calculating associated uncertainty (Wieczorek et al. 2004)^].

In many cases these can be determined directly from a <<gazetteer>> or from an online tool such as Google Maps. If the coordinates of a feature need to be determined from other reference points that have coordinates on a map (such as the corners), there is a nice little trick that can be done with the http://georeferencing.org/georefcalculator/gc.html[Georeferencing Calculator] to determine the coordinates of the feature easily. For example, to georeference the locality \"10 mi E (by air) Bakersfield\", first determine the coordinates for \"Bakersfield\". Suppose the xref:ui-coordinate-source[role=ui-element] is the USGS Gosford 1:24,000 Quad map.
